## SEAL TEAM SIX TRANSFORMATION MISSION BRIEFING

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the SEAL-TEAM-Six_ottomator-agents codebase. All operations must adhere to SEAL Team Six principles of excellence, discipline, preparedness, and mission focus.

## MISSION OVERVIEW

Transform the ottomator-agents repository into a SEAL Team Six standard codebase - elite, efficient, and mission-ready. This involves systematic enhancement of all agents to meet the highest standards of software engineering excellence.

## SEAL TEAM SIX OPERATING PRINCIPLES

### 1. EXCELLENCE IN EXECUTION
- **Zero Defect Mindset**: Every line of code must be production-ready
- **Precision Engineering**: No shortcuts, no compromises
- **Continuous Improvement**: Always seek to optimize and enhance

### 2. MISSION READINESS
- **100% Test Coverage**: Every function, every edge case
- **Documentation Discipline**: Clear, comprehensive, mission-critical
- **Deployment Ready**: Always maintain production-grade standards

### 3. TEAM INTEROPERABILITY
- **Standardized Operations**: Consistent patterns across all agents
- **Clear Communication**: Code that speaks for itself
- **Modular Architecture**: Components that work seamlessly together

### 4. OPERATIONAL SECURITY
- **Never Expose Secrets**: All credentials in secure environments
- **Defensive Coding**: Anticipate and prevent failures
- **Audit Trail**: Complete git history with detailed commits

## ST6 TRANSFORMATION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment & Setup
1. **COMMS Check**: Verify memory persistence (mem0 & Supabase)
2. **Fork Repository**: Establish operational control
3. **Create Mission Tracking**: TASK.md with metrics
4. **Establish Base Camp**: ST6-CLAUDE.md (this file)

### Phase 2: Systematic Transformation
1. **Rename & Reorganize**: ST6- prefix for transformed components
2. **Upgrade Dependencies**: Convert to uv Python management
3. **Standardize Architecture**: Apply consistent patterns
4. **Implement Testing**: Comprehensive test suites
5. **Document Operations**: Clear operational procedures

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance
1. **Code Review**: Line-by-line inspection
2. **Performance Optimization**: Elite-level efficiency
3. **Security Hardening**: Eliminate vulnerabilities
4. **Integration Testing**: Full system validation

## DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

### Code Structure
- **Max 500 lines per file**: Maintain tactical modularity
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Each module has one mission
- **DRY Principle**: Never repeat yourself
- **KISS Principle**: Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

### Python Standards
- **Type Hints**: Always specify types
- **Docstrings**: Google style for every function
- **Black Formatting**: Consistent code style
- **Pydantic Validation**: Data integrity at all times

### Testing Requirements
- **Pytest**: Unit tests for all functionality
- **Edge Cases**: Test the boundaries
- **Failure Scenarios**: Plan for Murphy's Law
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure elite-level speed

### Documentation
- **README.md**: Clear mission briefing for each agent
- **API Documentation**: Every endpoint documented
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual operational maps
- **Change Logs**: Complete mission history

## GIT COMMIT PROTOCOL

### Commit Message Format
```
[ST6-XXX] Operation: Brief description

Detailed explanation of changes:
- What was done
- Why it was necessary
- Impact on mission

Co-authored-by: JAMES BRANCHFORD ECHOLS, II <branch@softengineware.ai>
```

### Commit Discipline
- **Atomic Commits**: One logical change per commit
- **Frequent Commits**: Checkpoint progress regularly
- **Descriptive Messages**: Future operators must understand
- **Sign Your Work**: Always co-author attribution

## OPERATIONAL METRICS

Track and report on:
- **Transformation Progress**: % of codebase upgraded
- **Test Coverage**: Current vs. target
- **Performance Metrics**: Speed improvements
- **Security Score**: Vulnerability assessments
- **Documentation Coverage**: % documented

## MISSION PRIORITIES

1. **MVP Deployment**: MCP achieving mission readiness
2. **Core Infrastructure**: Memory persistence, testing, CI/CD
3. **Agent Enhancement**: Systematic upgrade of each agent
4. **Performance Optimization**: Elite-level efficiency
5. **Security Hardening**: Zero vulnerabilities

## FUTURE OPERATIONS

Document in TASK.md under "ST6 Future Upgrades":
- Performance enhancements
- Architecture improvements
- New capabilities
- Integration opportunities
- Scaling strategies

## REBOOT PROTOCOL

Before ending session:
1. **Create BRIEF_YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md**: Mission status
2. **Git commit push**: All changes secured
3. **Update TASK.md**: Current progress
4. **Verify memories**: Ensure persistence

## REMEMBER

- **Own Your Code**: Take pride in excellence
- **Team First**: Consider other developers
- **Mission Focus**: Stay on target
- **Never Quit**: Persistence in problem-solving
- **Leave No One Behind**: Document for the next operator
