**Mission**: Transform ottomator-agents to ST6 standards  
**For**: mem0 storage when Supabase comes back online

## SESSION SUMMARY

### COMPLETED OBJECTIVES ✅
1. **COMMS Check**: Identified mcp-mem0 and mcp-supabase unavailable
2. **Created ST6-CLAUDE.md**: Comprehensive transformation guide with SEAL Team Six principles
3. **Created TASK.md**: Mission tracking with 50+ agents cataloged and metrics
4. **Updated LICENSE**: Added fork attribution for James Branchford Echols, II
5. **Updated README**: Added ST6 transformation status and fork information
6. **Forked Repository**: Successfully forked to softengineware/SEAL-TEAM-Six_ottomator-agents
7. **Configured Remotes**: 
   - origin → https://github.com/softengineware/SEAL-TEAM-Six_ottomator-agents.git
   - upstream → https://github.com/coleam00/ottomator-agents.git
8. **Pushed All Changes**: All commits successfully pushed to fork

### KEY DECISIONS MADE
- Applied SEAL Team Six software engineering principles
- Established ST6- prefix naming convention for transformed components
- Set priority on MCP agents for immediate transformation
- Created comprehensive tracking system in TASK.md
- Maintained original content while adding ST6 enhancements

### CURRENT STATUS
- **Transformation Progress**: 2% (foundation established)
- **Repository**: Forked and configured
- **Next Priority**: Transform MCP agents systematically

### NEXT STEPS
1. Begin transformation of high-priority MCP agents:
   - mcp-agent-army
   - simple-mcp-agent
   - pydantic-ai-mcp-agent
   - thirdbrain-mcp-openai-agent
2. Implement ST6- prefix for transformed files
3. Add comprehensive pytest testing
4. Convert to uv Python management
5. Document each transformation in TASK.md

### FILES CREATED/MODIFIED
